This analysis using Tableau to analyze and visualize trends in power loss event (error code 41) happen on a mini computer 
that connect to a 12V car battery power supply through a solar charge controller.

Data used:
  - system event logs
  - daily summaries of precipitation amount in the zip code where the mini pc located at

Analysis:
  - Tableau Public dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/views/PowerLossTrendonMiniPC/KernelErrorCode41TrendonMiniPC?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
