1. Interpretation:
- The data spans from the year 1990 to 2024.
- The lowest price is 50.8 cents, and the highest is 344.1 cents.
- The trend: Coffee prices generally increase over time, although they fluctuate during different periods. For example, prices increased over a 5-year period from 1992 to 1997, 
then decreased during the next 5 years. The increasing period then expanded from 5 years to a 9-year period (2002 - 2011), followed by an 8-year increase (2011 - 2019). 

2. Prediction: 
My prediction is that prices will continue to rise from 2019 to at least 2024 and possibly up to 2029 before entering their regular downward cycle.
